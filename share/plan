JEAN PAUL SARTRE
	for Dodge Dartre

In my journey to the end of the night, I must rely not only on the
dialectical paths of reason.  I must have a good solid automobile,
one that eschews the futile trappings of worldly ennui and asks for
only the most basic maintenance.  My _Dodge Dartre_ offers me this basic
solace, and as interior parts fall off I am struck by the realisation
of their pointlessness.  I may not know if the window is up or down.
It is of no consequence.
